# IBM-ticker-API

This application connects to Alpha-Vantage and retrieves the latest IBM stock movements of the day. It shows the prices with 5min intervals.
The application then turns the data into a dataframe which the user can further manipulate. 
The program can generate graphs of the time series and the code can be altered to retrieve information for other major companies.
